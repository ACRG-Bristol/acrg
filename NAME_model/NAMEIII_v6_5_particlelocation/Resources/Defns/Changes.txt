Changes to NAME III definitions

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.0 of NAME III released 2/4/06.
Changes prior to version 4.0 not recorded.

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18/10/06 

MetDefnUM6Mpp.txt renamed to MetDefnUM6M4kmpp_1stDomain.txt to emphasis that this is
the 4km model not the old mesoscale model, and to indicate that this is the original
domain size which has now been increased.

TopogUM6M.pp renamed to TopogUM6M4km_1stDomain.pp for the same reasons. 
MetDefnUM6M4kmpp_1stDomain.txt edited to refer to this topography file.

MetDefnUM6M4kmpp.txt created for new expanded 4km domain size. File is currently 
identical to MetDefnUM6M4kmpp_1stDomain.txt except for reference to TopogUM6M4km.pp
and will need editing to reflect expanded domain. TopogUM6M4km.pp also needs creating.

File MetDefnUMV3M.txt corrected to replace references to UMHH2001M HCoord and 
UMHH2001M ZCoord with UMV3M HCoord and UMV3M ZCoord.

Version 4.1 of NAME III released 6/11/06.

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12/2/07

Various changes to met definition files:

File types 'Fields File' and 'PP File' replaced by 'Name II' and 'PP'.

Index arrays for NWP level numbers added and referred to in vertical grid definitions. 
This is needed for Name III to check the level numbers in the met files or, for GRIB 
met files, for Name III to find the correct data (because the NWP level numbers don't 
always match the Name III level numbers).

Field codes and 3-d flag added to each line of the NWP met file structure definitions. 
For NWP data from the Unified Model, the field codes are the stash codes. 

Dave Thomson

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12/2/07

In experimenting with code to check level indices on reading Name II format met files,
it became apparent that some H2001 regional files have headers which suggest they have
level 18 instead of level 19 data on the main (UV) vertical grid. 

Further investigation found four GPCS request files (we call them GPCS request files 
because such files are used by software used to request NWP data via the GPCS) in 
/home/name-dev/apnm/bin/wgdos called regh2001.reqff, gloh2001.reqff, reghv4.reqff and 
glohv4.reqff. Interpreting hv4 as H, these suggest that level 18 data was requested 
for H2001 regional and global and for H regional (but not H global which has a more 
drastic reduction in levels). 

Looking further at H and H2001 regional files, it seems that:
  01/01/99 - 29/03/99 inclusive (H) has level 18
  30/03/99 - 31/12/00 inclusive (i.e. until the end of H) has level 19
  01/01/01 - 04/08/02 inclusive (i.e. H2001 complete) has level 18.
So it looks like the error in level numbers was corrected on 30/03/99 but that the 
error was reintroduced for H2001 data. In addition H2001 global has level 18. (These 
findings are based on looking at just a sample of files, but comparing some field 
values with the WGOS archive as well as looking at the headers.)

As a result we have changed level 19 to 18 in MetDefnUMH2001R.txt and 
MetDefnUMH2001G.txt (and in the related files MetDefnUMH2001R_No10m.txt and 
MetDefnUMH2001R014074028082.txt), but not in MetDefnUMHR.txt as the majority of the H 
regional data has level 19. We have also changed the names of some grids etc as 
MetDefnUMHR.txt used the same names. We've done this by changing UMHRH2001GR to 
UMH2001GR18 everywhere except in the W Levels and ZGridW Indices, and by changing 
UMHH2001R to UMH2001R18 in the regional domain name. We have left MetDefnUMHR.txt 
unchanged, with UMHRH2001GR and UMHH2001R indicating that the HR grids etc are related 
to those in H2001G and H2001R.  

Note the above regards HR as ending at 31/12/00 when HG and HM ended, but in fact 
there are HR files overlapping in time with the whole of the H2001 period (these files 
were made from H2001R files). Over the whole of the HR period the periods of level 18 
and level 19 are about equal.

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14/2/07

Spacing within met definition files adjusted to make it easier to find differences 
between files.

The "Whole-4.5" domains serve no purpose for cut down met and so have been deleted in 
the cut down met definitions.

Comments in V3, H and H2001 met definitions corrected. The 10m specific humidity and 
10m cloud ice / water fields are proper model levels not extra diagnostics. Also the
diagnostic temperature level is 1.5m not 10m.

MetDefnUM5CammSahara.txt renamed MetDefnUM5CammSaharapp.txt as it contains a met 
definition involving PP files.

MetDefnUM6NAE.txt deleted as there is a pp version of this and there are no plans to 
produce a non-pp data feed or non-pp topography file.

A number of met definitions corrected so that the horizontal grid definitions involve
"x min", "y min" and "wrap?", not "x0", "y0" and "wrap", and so that the domain 
definitions involve "T Unbounded?".

Horizontal coords and grids in MetDefnUM6GL40.txt renamed to match those in 
MetDefnUM6G.txt. 

Some items in NAE and 4km definitions renamed for consistency and to avoid different 
met definitons, domains or horizontal grids with the same name.

PP versions of UM6R, UM6G and UM6GL40 created.

Dave Thomson

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14/2/07

MetDefnUM6M4kmpp.txt edited to reflect expanded region covered (see 18/10/06) above. In 
addition the names associated with the 4km model have been rationalised (we've dropped 
any reference to M or mesoscale and used numbers for the various regions (2) covered 
by the model at different times). Also the domain sizes (i.e. the domain definitions 
not the grid definitions) for the original region have been corrected.

Matthew Hort and Dave Thomson

Version 4.2 of NAME III released 14/2/07.

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23/2/07

Met definition file MetDefnUM6SAMpp.txt added for the South Asian model.

Met definition file MetDefnUM6NAEpp.txt corrected - the origin of the coordinate 
system (bottom left grid point on the main grid) was incorrect.

Matthew Hort

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18/5/07

Half life of Krypton-85 corrected.

Species.txt edited to include new radionuclides required by HPA-RPD. Added 
radionuclides are
  1. Noble gases: ARGON-41, KRYPTON-87, RADON-222, XENON-135M 
  2. Others: BARIUM-137M, BISMUTH-214, CARBON-14, HYDROGEN-3, IODINE-129, Lead-214, 
     PLUTONIUM-242, POLONIUM-218, PRASEODYMIUM-144, RADIUM-226, RUBIDIUM-88, 
     SELENIUM-75, SULPHUR-35, URANIUM-234, YTTERBIUM-169.

Iodine isotopes split into organic (IODINE_O) and inorganic (IODINE_E).

List broken into three sections:
  1. Chemistry Species (no changes).
  2. Radionuclides defined with surface resistances. Surface resistances for new items 
     not known so set to zero (max deposition) except for noble gases (deposition 
     velocity set to zero) and IODINE-129 (value set to value for IODINE-131). All old
     items were previously defined with surface resistance or zero deposition 
     velocity and so fit into the list with no change needed. Note IODINE_O and 
     IODINE_E properties are identical in this section which will be incorrect for 
     deposition. The wet deposition type for the new items has been set to 1 except 
     for the noble gases where it has been set to zero.
  3. Radionuclides defined with deposition velocities. Velocities defined by HPA-RPD.
     0 for noble gases, 1.00E-05 for organic iodine, 1.0E-02 for inorganic iodine, 
     1.0E-03 for everything else.

Version 4.3 of NAME III released 18/5/07.

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15/8/07

Corrections to MetDefnUM6_4km2pp.txt: stash codes for dynamic cloud liquid water and 
ice corrected; 'Suffix' changed from 4KM2_UM6.PP to 4KM2_UM6.pp; Name of 'Met File 
Structure Definition' changed to UM6_4km.

Also the name of the 'Met File Structure Definition' in MetDefnUM6_4km1pp.txt changed 
from UM5 to UM6. This is for consistency only - Met File Structure Definitions called 
UM5 and UM6 exist in other met definition files and are identical.

Maria Athanassiadou and Dave Thomson

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.0 of NAME III released 24/8/07.

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

27/9/07

MetDefnUM6SAMpp.txt copied, renamed MetDefnUM6SAMpp_dt3.txt, and edited for use with 3 
hourly data.

Matthew Hort

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9/11/07

MetDefnUM6NAEpp.txt copied and renamed MetDefnUM6NAEpp_old_large.txt (to indicate the 
older larger NAE domain).

MetDefnUM6NAEpp.txt edited to refer to the newer smaller NAE domain (H-Coords and 
H-Grids changed).

Matthew Hort and Claire Witham

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

26/11/07

MetDefnUM6_4km50Lpp.txt created. This is based on MetDefnUM6_4km2pp.txt but has 
changed met file suffix, topography file, and vertical coords, grids and arrays. Also
a second roughness length field (Field code - i.e. "stash code" - 3026) has been added 
at the end of the NWP met file structure definition. In the domain which excludes a 
region round the edge, the excluded region has been extended from 4.5 to 8.5 grid 
lengths.

Matthew Hort

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19/12/07

MetDefnUM6NAEpp_old_large.txt edited to refer to the topography file as 
TopogUM6NAE_old_large.pp.

MetDefnUM6NAEpp.txt edited to refer to the correct horizontal domains (i.e. the things
in the "Domains:" block, not grids or coord systems).

Claire Witham

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

31/12/07

Met definition file MetDefnUM6REGNAEpp.txt added for the cut-out of the NAE.

Claire Witham

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

28/1/08

MetDefnUM6SAMpp_dt3_z38.txt created. This is like MetDefnUM6SAMpp_dt3.txt but 
extending to 38 levels rather than 31.

Matthew Hort

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

29/1/08

MetDefnUM6_4km50Lpp.txt

Array names in this met definition file have been made unique to this definition to 
allow the met to be nested.  The previous version was incompatible with using other 
met definition files.

Claire Witham

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8/3/08

MetDefnUM6SAMpp_dt3.txt and MetDefnUM6SAMpp_dt3_z38.txt renamed 
MetDefnUM6SAM_dt3pp.txt and MetDefnUM6SAML38_dt3pp.txt. Domain top of the latter 
increased to reflect the 38 levels.

MetDefnUM6_4km50Lpp.txt: horizontal coords and grids given the same name as in 
MetDefnUM6_4km2pp.txt as they are the same coords/grids.

Name of 'met file structure definition' in SAM and NAE definitions changed to UM6 for 
consistency. Both UM5 and UM6 structures are the same, but we now call it UM5/6 in all 
UM5/6 definitions.

MetDefnUM6REGNAEpp.txt altered to use the same horizontal coord system as 
MetDefnUM6NAEpp.txt and the horizontal grid and domain definitions have been altered
accordingly.

Dave Thomson

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12/3/08

Renaming of 4km and NAE met definition and topography files. 

The following changes have been made to the met definition names:
MetDefnUM6_4km1pp.txt         -> MetDefnUM4kmMk1pp.txt
MetDefnUM6_4km2pp.txt         -> MetDefnUM4kmMk2pp.txt
MetDefnUM6_4km50Lpp.txt       -> MetDefnUM4kmMk3_L50pp.txt
MetDefnUM6NAEpp_old_large.txt -> MetDefnUMNAEMk1pp.txt
MetDefnUM6NAEpp.txt           -> MetDefnUMNAEMk2pp.txt

The idea is to drop the '6' in 'UM6' since the met definitions are not tied to UM 
versions and introduce 'Mk1' (Mark 1) etc to denote successive UM configurations. The 
bit after the underscore (e.g. 'L50' here) does not indicate anything about the UM 
configuration but indicates what we extract from the UM. These names should provide a 
template for future changes. The bit after the underscore is optional and is used 
either if there is some feature we want reminding of or if we take two data feeds from 
the same UM configuration. E.g. the future global 70 level model might generate two 
met definitions MetDefnUMGMk2_L50.txt and MetDefnUMGMk2_L70.txt (or we could use 'Mk6'
to allow the possibility of extending this naming convention back to 'V3' data at some 
point in the future). Similarly a cut out from the global could be 
MetDefnUMGMk2_L50Zone4.txt or MetDefnUMGMk2_L50Reg4.txt (Reg4 = 'region 4').

No other met definitions have been renamed, nor have any of the met file 'suffices'. 
The aim is to provide a consistent approach for the future rather than to cause 
unnecessary hassle by changing historical names. 

Similarly most of the internal names used within these 5 met definition files haven't 
been altered, although there is an exception for the met definitions themselves and 
the domains. Other aspects could be rationalised later. 

The topography files for these 5 met definitions have been renamed to be consistent:
TopogUM6_4km1.pp         -> TopogUM4kmMk1.pp 
TopogUM6_4km2.pp         -> TopogUM4kmMk2.pp
TopogUM6_4km50L.pp       -> TopogUM4kmMk3_L50.pp
TopogUM6NAE_old_large.pp -> TopogUMNAEMk1.pp
TopogUM6NAE.pp           -> TopogUMNAEMk2.pp

Dave Thomson

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

29/5/08

Met definitions added:

MetDefnUMNAEMk1pp_dt3.txt   :   For NAE 
				full horizontal Mk1 domain 
				21 vertical levels	
				reading every 3 hrs
                                useful for most of 2006 data that are 3 hrly.

MetDefnUMNAEMk1pp_21vl.txt  :   Like above for 1 hrly data
                                
Maria Athanassiadou      
                          
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12/6/08

Met definition MetDefnUMREGNAEdt3pp.txt added.

Matthew Hort

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.1 of NAME III released 11/7/08.
Note a number of earlier changes (listed below) were not included in 5.1.

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

27/11/07

Species.txt - changed surface resistance and deposition velocity for O3 so that 
it doesn't deposit. The chemistry scheme has a seperate method for ozone dry 
deposition under the 'Plume Particles' ozone method. If however using the 'Background 
Particles' method the old values should be used and these values are recorded in 
comments at the start of the file. For the 'Ozone Field' method deposition isn't 
currently treated and so the values are not significant.

Alison Redington

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

28/3/08

Species PM10_MINERAL and PM10_SEA_SALT added to species file for dust and sea salt
simulations.

Dave Thomson

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1/5/08

NAMEChemistrySpecies.txt

Removed the O3 surface resistance value and set Deposition Velocity to 0.0
to bring into line with the new definition in Species.txt following the
addition of the new ozone scheme.

Claire Witham

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15/7/08

Met definitions renamed for consistency:

MetDefnUMNAEMk1pp_dt3.txt  -> MetDefnUMNAEMk1_L21dt3pp.txt
MetDefnUMNAEMk1pp_21vl.txt -> MetDefnUMNAEMk1_L21pp.txt
                                
Dave Thomson

Version 5.2 of NAME III released 28/7/08.

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5/8/08

NAMEChemistryGridDefn.txt

Updated to have 100m levels up to 4km as this seems to work best with the 
new ozone chemistry and reduce the errors of high ozone in the upper levels

Claire Witham

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

29/10/08

Extra stashes for correct roughness length (3026) and soil moisture (8223) 
added to met definition files

MetDefnUM6Gpp.txt
MetDefnUM6GL40pp.txt
MetDefnUMNAEMk2pp.txt
MetDefnUM6Rpp.txt
MetDefnUM6REGNAEpp.txt
MetDefnUM6SAM_dt3pp.txt
MetDefnUM4kmMk3_L50pp.txt

Helen Webster

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25/11/08

NAMEChemistrySpecies.txt
Species.txt

H2S added to the species list.  Deposition values have been mapped to SO2.  In
reality H2S is less soluble than SO2 so it's wet deposition is probably between
2 to 10 times less.

Claire Witham and Alex Archibald

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

27/1/09

New met defns added for cut-up domains of GLOUM6pp files (MetDefnUM6Gpp_PT1.txt
to MetDefnUM6Gpp_PT14.txt) The domains are described in 
md17_1_v1(Global_cutoutdomains).pdf

Lucy Davis

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10/2/09

Half life added for U-235 and U-238 (previously these were given as stable).

Species.txt has been revised to include daughter and branching ratio information for 
radioactive decay chain modelling. Also added are additional radionuclides arising 
from the decay of other radionuclides. Where there are more than one possible 
(unstable) daughter species (with branching ratio > 0.01), multiple lines have been 
added to the species file (although modelling multiple daughter species is not 
currently possible in NAME). A separate block has been added containing the original
radionuclides without the daughter species (and without multiple lines for multiple 
branches) for use when full decay chain modelling is not required. This file has been 
fully tested by the HPA.

Caesium 137A/137B have been removed. These were identical to Caesium 137 (apart from 
the name) and are no longer needed.

A Cloud_Gamma_Params.txt has been added which includes all the required
parameters for the Cloud Gamma Parameters block required in NAME input
files when estimating cloud gamma dose. Note that this file has not yet been
tested by HPA. This has been highlighted in the file. When HPA have tested this
file they will inform the Dispersion Group, who should update
Cloud_Gamma_Params.txt accordingly.

A column for cloud gamma information has been added to species.txt but is currently 
blank.

Peter Bedwell

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23/2/09

Extra stashes for new roughness length (3026) and soil moisture (8223) 
added to the cut-up-global met definition files.

Dave Thomson

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.3 of NAME III released 25/2/09.

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

29/6/09

MetDefnUM6REGNAEpp.txt

Changed name of 'Met File Structure Definition' to 'UM6NAE' to allow
nested run with UM6R. Previously both had been called 'UM6'.

Alistair Manning

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

30/6/09

Species.txt

Added HYDROGEN as an allowed species.  The Deposition velocity is a global mean 
derived from Price et al (2007, JGR 112), but has since been superceded by 
EuroHydros values that are hardwired in Particle.F90.  The hard-wired values
will be used on any species that has a name starting with "HYDROGEN".

Claire Witham

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

30/6/09

NAMEChemistrySpecies_BackgroundPart.txt

Added this new species definition file for use with the "Background Particles"
chemistry option, where a deposition velocity for ozone needs to be specified.
For all other chemistry options the original NAMEChemistrySpecies.txt file 
should be used.

(Note: This may not be the ideal solution for this problem in the long-run, 
       but is included here so this information isn't lost)

Claire Witham

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21/7/09

MetDefnUM1p5kmpp.txt

Added new met definition for 1.5km met (MetDefnUM1p5kmpp.txt)

Helen Webster

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8/10/09

Met definitions added for 70 level global and NAE models:

MetDefnUMG_Mk5_L52pp.txt
MetDefnUMG_Mk5_L59pp.txt
MetDefnUMNAE_Mk3_L42Rpp.txt
MetDefnUMNAE_Mk3_L52pp.txt
MetDefnUMNAE_Mk3_L6UKpp.txt
MetDefnUMR_Mk5_L52pp.txt (regional cut out of global model)
    
Andrew Jones

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21/10/09

NAMEChemistrySpecies.txt and NAMEChemistrySpecies_BackgroundPart.txt

Added C5H8BIO, C10H16BIO, SOA, SOAP species (related to changes made to NAME
III code for biogenics by Ali)

Helen Webster 

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

26/11/09

The provisional met definition file 'MetDefnUM1p5kmpp.txt' for use with data from the 
1.5 km version of the Unified Model has been updated to use the new naming conventions 
(inclusion of a Mk number and level/local processing information where appropriate). 
The file has been renamed as 'MetDefnUM1p5km_Mk1_L57pp.txt'. The changes are largely 
in the names of the met definition, domains, grids, etc. but there is one material 
change with the 'Z Max' value in the domain definition being reduced to the value 
appropriate for the 57 levels contained in the met files.

Andrew Jones

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

26/11/09

Various 'Met File Structure Definition's renamed for consistency across met 
definitions. The changes are as follows:

The following files now have Met File Structure Definition = UM5:
MetDefnUM4kmMk1pp.txt
MetDefnUM6G.txt
MetDefnUM6GL40.txt
MetDefnUM6R.txt
MetDefnUM6REGNAEDt3pp.txt
MetDefnUM6SAML38_dt3pp.txt
MetDefnUM6SAMpp.txt
MetDefnUMNAEMk1_L21dt3pp.txt
MetDefnUMNAEMk1_L21pp.txt
MetDefnUMNAEMk1pp.txt
The following file now has Met File Structure Definition = UM6:
MetDefnUM6REGNAEpp.txt

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10/12/09

NAMEChemistrySpecies.txt and NAMEChemistrySpecies_BackgroundPart.txt

Correct surface resistance for NAER and NH4NO3 to 1.00E+03 (aerosol value). 
(Note that revisions to the dry deposition scheme mean that the surface
resistance of aerosols is assumed to be zero in the code)

Helen Webster (on behalf of Alison Redington)

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18/12/09

MetDefnUMNAE_Mk3_L52pp.txt, MetDefnUMNAE_Mk3_L6UKpp.txt,
MetDefnUMG_Mk5_L52pp.txt, MetDefnUMR_Mk5_L52pp.txt,
MetDefnUM1p5km_Mk1_L57pp.txt, MetDefnUMG_Mk5_L59pp.txt,
MetDefnUMNAE_Mk3_L42Rpp.txt.

NAME code now adapted to read extra stashes in UM met file (canopy water,
canopy height and stomatal conductance) so fields added to end of NWP Met File
Structure Definition.

Helen Webster

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25/01/2010

Species.txt, NAMEChemistrySpecies.txt and
NAMEChemistrySpecies_BackgroundPart.txt - Mean aerosol diameter added for
aerosols (PM10, sulphate, particulate, SOA, NH4NO3, NH42SO4, NAER). Surface
resistance and deposition velocity columns must be blank for aerosols. Note
that PM10 and particulate values are currently estimated and awaiting
further input from Roy Harrison.

Species_LandUseDryDep.txt, NAMEChemistrySpecies_LandUseDryDep.txt and
NAMEChemistrySpecies_BackgroundPart_LandUseDryDep.txt - Addition of mean aerosol
diameter as above. CH4 (methane) added to Species_LandUseDryDep.txt. "Land use 
dependent dry dep" column added to denote whether the new land use dependent dry
deposition scheme is used. This column is given the value "Yes" for species: 
sulphur dioxide, ammonia, NO, NO2, HNO3, O3, CO, HCHO, CH4 and PAN. For cases 
where "Land use dependent dry dep" is set to "Yes", the "Surface Resistance", 
"Deposition Velocity" and "Mean aerosol diameter" columns must be blank.

Helen Webster

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11/02/10

Met definitions added for 25 km global model (Mk 6) and 70-level South Asia (Mk 2)
models:

MetDefnUMG_Mk6_L59pp.txt   (full-domain global met)
MetDefnUMG_Mk6_L59PTpp.txt (domain-decomposed global met)
MetDefnUMSAM_Mk2_L52pp.txt

Note that '_01' versions have also been added for back-compatibility with earlier
versions of NAME unable to read the extra UM stash fields (canopy water,
canopy height and stomatal conductance).

Also note that a slight amendment has been made to the existing met definition files
(including _01 versions) for the 70-level NAE (Mk 3) model. This is to reflect the
new start date for the 70-level NAE (originally introduced at PS22 but then deferred
to PS23 instead). It was felt this correction was sufficiently minor not to warrant
a new version of the met definitions.

Met definitions added for 52 level 25km global model (Mk6):

MetDefnUMG_Mk6_L52PTpp.txt

This MetDefn includes dummy fields for the top 7 UM levels to allow only 52 levels of
the 59 level met data files to be used. 

Note that '_01' version has also been added for back-compatibility with earlier
versions of NAME unable to read the extra UM stash fields (canopy water,
canopy height and stomatal conductance).

NAMEChemistrySpecies files updated with changes for wet deposition. The column
keyword "Wet Type" has been removed and replaced with three new column headers
"Wet Dep?", "A" and "B". "Wet Dep?" is compulsory whereas "A" and "B" are
optional. For Wet Type 0 (no deposition), set "Wet Dep?" to be "No". Any values 
given for A and B will be ignored. For Wet Type 1 (standard scheme based on work
by Tom Choularton), set "Wet Dep?" to "Yes" and leave "A" and "B" blank. For Wet
Type 2 (SO2), set "Wet Dep?" to "Yes", "A" to "2.4E-5" and "B" to "0.79". Note 
the user can input any other wet deposition coefficients in the same way as for 
Wet Type 2 described above.

Met definition added for use with the ECMWF ERA-Interim met files in our long-term
archive:

MetDefnECMWF_ERAInt_Regional.txt

The met files are in GRIB Edition 1 format and are created specifically for NAME.
Met data extends over an area 105W - 60E, 9N - 81N (approximately equivalent to
the old 'REG' domain) at 0.75 degree resolution and to model level 24 (~ 80 hPa).
The ERA-Interim met archive starts from 01/01/1989.

a) Met definitions added for use with additional sets of ECMWF ERA-Interim met files
retrieved for volcanic ash case studies:

MetDefnECMWF_ERAInt_Alaska.txt
MetDefnECMWF_ERAInt_WPacific.txt

The met files are in GRIB Edition 1 format and are created specifically for NAME.
For Alaska: met data extends over an area 150E - 90W, 30N - 90N  at 0.75 degree
resolution and extending to model level 20 (~ 35 hPa).
For WPacific: met data extends over an area 90E - 180E, 45S - 45N  at 0.75 degree
resolution and using all model vertical levels.

b) Met definitions added for use with ECMWF ERA40 met files:

MetDefnECMWF_ERA40_Regional.txt
MetDefnECMWF_ERA40_WPacific.txt

The met files are in GRIB Edition 1 format and are created specifically for NAME.
For Regional: met data extends over an area 108W - 63E, 9N - 81N (approximately
equivalent to the old 'REG' domain) at 1.125 degree resolution and extending to
model level 24 (~ 80 hPa).
For WPacific: met data extends over an area 45E - 180E, 45S - 45N  at 1.125 degree

Ticket #24: Revised NAME met definitions for GLOBAL UM at PS25

The UM STASH code for the dynamic rain rate field in our GPCS met data feed is
changing from 4203 to 20068 for GLOBAL UM files at PS25 (Nov 2010). The new code
takes output from a filtered precipitation field, which is designed to remove
excessive drizzle from the GLOBAL UM. It is a temporary filtering until raw model
output can be improved and the change will then be reversed at some stage in
the future.

NAME can handle the new STASH code by duplicating a second met field with the
alternative STASH code in the Met File Structure definition. NAME will only use
the field that is present in the met file and will ignore the other STASH code.
This approach will enable NAME to run seamlessly on either of the two above codes.

The following met definition files have been updated with this change:

 - MetDefnUMG_Mk6_L59pp.txt
 - MetDefnUMG_Mk6_L59PTpp.txt
 - MetDefnUMG_Mk6_L52PTpp.txt

Ticket #32: Upgrade GRIB support in NAME to use the ECMWF GRIB_API library package.

The following changes have been made to each met definition file for GRIB-formatted
NWP met data:

a) In the "NWP Met Definitions:" block, the value of the column keyword "File Type"
   has been changed from 'GRIB Edition 1' to 'GRIB' (as the GRIB_API is able to
   handle different GRIB editions in a seamless way).

b) The NWP Z-Grid level index corresponding to a NAME level index of 1 (i.e. for a
   surface or single-level field) has been changed from '-1' to '0'. An NWP level
   index of 0 causes the field to be read in using the single-level index of the
   met file (i.e. where the level index is not explicitly matched against).

c) Removed the parameter table part of the field codes given in the NWP Met File
   Structure Definition. The field code is now simply the parameter identifier
   (e.g. '128131' becomes '131').

The following met definition files have been updated with these three changes:

 - MetDefnECMWF_EPS_Mk1_L26R.txt
 - MetDefnECMWF_OPER_Mk1_L55R.txt
 - MetDefnECMWF_OPER_Mk1_L55RDt6.txt
 - MetDefnECMWF_ERA40_Regional.txt
 - MetDefnECMWF_ERA40_WPacific.txt

Ticket #46: Revised NAME met definitions for ECMWF forecast data at IFS cycle 37r2.

a) Revised the three 'Mk1' ECMWF met definition files to include an '_Mk1' in the
   respective topography filenames. This reflects a renaming of the topography files
   (which are stored separately from the NAME code library) to improve their
   identification, viz.
   
   - TopogECMWF_OPER_T1279L91_Regional --> TopogECMWF_OPER_Mk1_T1279L91_Regional
   - TopogECMWF_EPS_T639L62_Regional   --> TopogECMWF_EPS_Mk1_T639L62_Regional

b) Added three new met definition files for use with 'Mk2' ECMWF forecast data:
   
   - MetDefnECMWF_EPS_Mk2_L26R.txt
   - MetDefnECMWF_OPER_Mk2_L55R.txt
   - MetDefnECMWF_OPER_Mk2_L55RDt6.txt

   The 'Mk2' met data files have model-level fields encoded in GRIB-2 format.
   This change to GRIB-2 does not require any change in the met definitions, per se,
   however a new Mk is sensible here given the change in file structure.
   
   Separately to the change to GRIB-2, the opportunity has also been taken to
   revise the parameter codes of any fields that undergo prior processing for use
   in NAME (such as precipitation fields). The GRIB keys of these processed fields
   are now being modified to better identify their contents.
   
   i)  For OPER forecasts, the field codes have been modified for:
         - dynamic rain rate (kg/(m^2 s))    set to 104
         - convective rain rate (kg/(m^2 s)) set to 105
   ii) For EPS forecasts, the field codes have been modified for:
         - surface stress (u-cpt) (N/m^2)    set to 086
         - surface stress (v-cpt) (N/m^2)    set to 087
         - surface sensible heat flux        set to 085
         - dynamic rain rate (kg/(m^2 s))    set to 104
         - convective rain rate (kg/(m^2 s)) set to 105
   Note that 104/105 are actually the dynamic/convective precipitation rates
   (i.e. no discrimination between rain and snow) and by using the rain components
   here, NAME will assume that any precipitation here is rainfall.

Ticket #47: Additional NAME met definitions for use with ECMWF ERA40 met data

Met definitions added for use with additional sets of ECMWF ERA40 met files:

MetDefnECMWF_ERA40_NEurope.txt
MetDefnECMWF_ERA40_NAmerica.txt

The met files are in GRIB Edition 1 format and are created specifically for NAME.
For NEurope: met data extends over an area 45W - 63E, 54N - 85.5N  at 1.125 degree
resolution and extending to model level 20 (~ 35 hPa).
For NAmerica: met data extends over an area 180W - 63W, 18N - 63N  at 1.125 degree
resolution and extending to model level 20 (~ 35 hPa).

These met definitions were created for use in volcanic ash case studies, although
there is no reason why they cannot be used more generally for the specified domains.

Ticket #62: Remove or restructure obsolete met definition files.

The existing set of NAME met definition files was reviewed by Andrew Jones and
Helen Champion in December 2011.

a) Some met definitions were found to be deprecated (in the sense that we no longer
   have any actual met files relevant to that definition file, and would need to
   recreate such met files either from old WGOS archives or from our ADG archives,
   e.g. area cutouts).
   
   The following deprecated met definitions have been moved into a new subfolder
   'Resources/Defns/Deprecated':
   
     - MetDefnUMV3G.txt
     - MetDefnUM6GL40.txt
     - MetDefnUM6GL40pp.txt
     - MetDefnUMG_Mk5_L59pp.txt
     - MetDefnUMNAEMk1pp.txt
     - MetDefnUMNAEMk1_L21pp.txt
     - MetDefnUMNAEMk1_L21dt3pp.txt
     - MetDefnUMNAEMk2pp.txt
     - MetDefnUM4kmMk1pp.txt
     - MetDefnUM6SAMpp.txt
     - MetDefnUMHR013075028084.txt
     - MetDefnUMH2001R014074028082.txt
     - MetDefnUMHM013097043135.txt
     - MetDefnUMHM014098044137.txt
     - MetDefnUM5CammSaharapp.txt
   
b) Two met definition files were found to be redundant as they have never been used.
   The 'pp' definitions corresponding to the 'UM5R' and 'UM5MDt1' met types have
   been removed completely:
   
     - MetDefnUM5Rpp.txt
     - MetDefnUM5MDt1pp.txt
   
c) The treatment of 10-metre diagnostic wind fields in the met definitions for
   'UMHR' and 'UMH2001R' has been revised so that these are no longer used.
   It is thought that this will give better mass consistency near the ground surface.
   The revised met definition files  
   
     - MetDefnUMHR.txt
     - MetDefnUMH2001R.txt
   
   do not use the 10-metre diagnostic wind fields that are present in the met files.
   If required, met definitions using the 10-metre diagnostic wind fields are
   available in the subfolder 'Resources/Defns/Deprecated' and are renamed as
   
     - MetDefnUMHR_With10mWinds.txt
     - MetDefnUMH2001R_With10mWinds.txt

Ticket #81: Minor tweaks to wet scavenging coefficients for in-cloud ice

In-cloud ice A scavenging parameter changed to A = 5.2 * 10^-5 for aerosols in the
various species files. In line with this, the in-cloud ice A scavenging parameters
for SO2 and H2S have been modified since they were based on the EMEP ratio of
the scavenging coefficients between SO4 (an aerosol) and SO2 and a view as to the 
relative sizes of the SO2 and H2S scavenging coefficients. The in-cloud ice value A =
5.2 * 10^-5 has also been used for various other species in Species.txt and 
Species_LandUseDryDep.txt (e.g. radionuclides) in the absence of any better estimates.

NAMEChemistrySpecies_LandUseDryDep.txt

Ticket #85: Chemistry restructure.

Various changes made to species files to reflect restructuring of Chemistry.

"FieldSpecies:" blocks added to the following files to record information on the
species stored on fields:
 NAMEChemistrySpecies.txt
 NAMEChemistrySpecies_BackgroundPart.txt
 NAMEChemistrySpecies_LandUseDryDep.txt
 NAMEChemistrySpecies_BackgroundPart_LandUseDryDep.txt

O3 and H2O2 removed from Species block in the non-'BackgroundPart' files.

NAMEChemistrySpecies_BackgroundPart.txt already gave SOA and SOAP a molecular weight
of 195.47. Other species files have now been aligned with this.

"Land use dependent dry dep" column added to non-'LandUseDryDep' files and some other
minor differences between files (e.g. spacing) removed, in order to make it easier to
look at differences between files.

"Land use dependent dry dep" value for H2O2 corrected to "no".

Species.txt and Species_LandUse.txt changed to give non-zero O3 deposition velocity
(Species.txt only) and to add H2O2.

The NAMEChemistryGridDefn.txt file has been changed to a commonly used set up for
policy support work. The grid is ~ 10km by 10km and extends across a limited European
domain from ~ 14W to 20E and 42N to 62N, with 100m levels in the vertical up to
1000m and 500m levels up to 5000m.

Ticket #84: Update NAME to treat cloud properly under PC2.

The "NWP Met File Structure Definition" blocks in the NWP met definition files were
changed to remove 'dynamic' from the following field names
  dynamic cloud liquid water (kg/kg)
  dynamic cloud ice (kg/kg)
  dynamic high cloud amount (0-1)
  dynamic medium cloud amount (0-1)
  dynamic low cloud amount (0-1)
and to add the 'Field Qualifiers' variable. For the 5 cloud fields listed above,
Field Qualifiers is equal to 'total' for UM global cases from Mk6 onwards, for ECMWF
cases, and for UM UKV cases, and is equal to 'dynamic' for the other cases. The value
doesn't matter for the UKV as there is no parametrised convection. Note the global
model actually changed to total cloud mid way through Mk6 (on 14 July 2010). For more
details of the motivation for this change see the Code_NameIII changes file entry
dated 10/09/2013.

Ticket #105: Update met definition files following recent UM changes (PS33/PS34).

Added new met definition files for Global (Mk8) and Euro4 (Mk1) datasets from

but with modifications for the PC2 scheme (the 'Field Qualifier' variable, etc.).

 MetDefnUMG_Mk8_L52PTpp.txt

Ticket #104: Read UKPP and EuroPP Precipitation

Added radar definition files to enable NAME to use precipitation analyses from the
Met Office's UKPP and EuroPP nowcasting systems:

 RadarDefnUKPP_Mk1_Inst5min_Nimrod.txt
 RadarDefnUKPP_Mk1_Inst15min_Nimrod.txt
 RadarDefnUKPP_Mk1_Accum1hr_Nimrod.txt

 RadarDefnEuroPP_Mk1_Inst15min_Nimrod.txt
 RadarDefnEuroPP_Mk1_Inst15min_UK_Nimrod.txt

The definition files associated with the UKPP give the options to read instantaneous
precipitation rate at 5 minute or 15 minute frequency, or alternatively, to use hourly
accumulated precipitation (which can be interpreted as an hourly time-mean rate).
The definition that might be used in practice will depend on data availability.
Instantaneous precipitation rate is available at 15 minute intervals for EuroPP fields.
The "_UK" version of the EuroPP radar definition gives a precipitation cut-out field
over the UK (referred to historically as "Nimrod radar files" as they were provided
from an old nowcasting system at the Met Office called Nimrod). The "Nimrod" reference
in the above radar definition files refers to the bespoke data format that has been
retained from the old Nimrod nowcasting system.

Note that UKPP fields are at a spatial resolution of 2 km and EuroPP fields are 5 km.

The corresponding changes to the model code are general enough so that we are able
to read precipitation, precipitation type, cloud, snow probability, etc. from the UKPP
and EuroPP datasets into NAME. The radar definition files listed above, however, are
set up to enable the model to read instantaneous precipitation rate or one-hour
accumulations (time means) only. This is because, at present, NAME can only utilise
these precipitation fields and, although the mechanism is now in place to read other
fields, there is no NAME code yet in place to use them.

NAMEChemistrySpecies_BackgroundPart.txt,
NAMEChemistrySpecies_LandUseDryDep.txt and
NAMEChemistrySpecies_BackgroundPart_LandUseDryDep.txt.

NAMEChemistryGridDefn.txt changed to work with the new grid structures required by the 
Eulerian fields. Also NameChemistryGridDefn.txt split into two versions - 
NameChemistryGridDefn_ZAGL.txt using the usual vertical m agl coordinate system and 
NameChemistryGridDefn_Eta.txt using a vertical eta coordinate system.

Ticket #109: Add Mk3 met definition files for real-time ECMWF forecast data.

Added new met definition files intended for use with the current forecast model
configurations at ECMWF (these are labelled as Mk3 in our naming convention):

 MetDefnECMWF_OPER_Mk3_L72R.txt
 MetDefnECMWF_EPS_Mk3_L36R.txt

The 'OPER' definition is for use with the routine feed of forecast met files from
the operational (deterministic) global forecast model. The Met Office receives fields
for a regional domain covering 90 W to 90 E and 20 N to 90 N (for the North Atlantic
and Europe) on a selection of 72 model levels. The 'EPS' definition is for use with
ensemble forecast data from the ECMWF Ensemble Prediction System over the same domain
on a selection of 36 model vertical levels.

Note that the precipitation input parameters have been changed between 'Mk2' and 'Mk3'.
At 'Mk2', NAME read the "dynamic precipitation" and "convective precipitation" fields
(allocated to the 'rainfall' components). So there was a dynamic/convective partition,
but all precipitation was treated as rain. At 'Mk3', NAME reads the "total rainfall"
and "total snowfall" fields (allocated to 'dynamic' components). So there is now a
rain/snow discrimination but no dynamic/convective split. This is more consistent for
the modelling of wet deposition under the PC2 changes (given the lack of convective
cloud information in these ECMWF data sets).

Ticket #108: Activities associated with freezing of version 6.4.

Added the met definition file MetDefnECMWF_ERAInt_Australia.txt for use with ECMWF
ERA-Interim reanalysis meteorology for the Australian region.

The met files are in GRIB Edition 1 format and are created specifically for NAME.
The met data covers a domain over Australia and the Pacific Ocean, which extends over
the area 45E - 120W, 75S - 30N  at 0.75 degree resolution, up to model level 22
(~ 55 hPa).

This met definition file had been overlooked when the ERA-Interim met definition files
were originally included in the NAME trunk.

Ticket #113: Met dependent meander scheme

Default values for variables (sigma_u and tau_u) in the parametrization of unresolved 
mesoscale motions (previously referred to as the meander parametrization) have been 
added to the NWP Met Definition block in the met definition files using the column 
headers "Mesoscale SigU" and "Mesoscale TauU". The default values are NWP resolution 
dependent (spatial and temporal) and are roughly taken from Webster et al. (2015): 
"Parametrizing unresolved low-frequency mesoscale motions in NAME."

4km / UKV / <= 4 km, hourly: sigma_u = 0.55 m/s, tau_u = 6500 s
Mesoscale / ~10km, hourly: sigma_u = 0.7 m/s, tau_u = 8000 s
Global / ~20 km, 3-hourly: sigma_u = 0.8 m/s, tau_u = 10000 s
Global / ~40 km, 3-hourly: sigma_u = 0.9 m/s, tau_u = 10000 s
Global / >=60 km, 3- or 6-hourly: sigma_u = 0.95 m/s, tau_u = 10000 s

Ticket #128: Add met definitions for ENDGame version of UKV and Euro4.

Added met definition files for the ENDGame version of the UKV (Mk3) and Euro4 (Mk2)
introduced at PS35.

 MetDefnUM1p5km_Mk3_L57PTpp.txt
 MetDefnUM1p5km_Mk3_L57pp.txt

 MetDefnUME4_Mk2_L57ICEpp.txt
 MetDefnUME4_Mk2_L57NWpp.txt

The met definition files for the previous Mks have also been updated to include
the end date of their met files in the header description.

 MetDefnUM1p5km_Mk2_L57PTpp.txt
 MetDefnUM1p5km_Mk2_L57pp.txt

 MetDefnUME4_Mk1_L57ICEpp.txt

Ticket #132: Add 'Mk9' global met definition files.

Added met definition files for use with Mk9 Global UM met data introduced at PS36.

 MetDefnUMG_Mk9_L52PTpp.txt
 MetDefnUMG_Mk9_L59PT2pp.txt
 MetDefnUMG_Mk9_L59PTpp.txt
 MetDefnUMG_Mk9_L59pp.txt

These are associated with the introduction of a revised orography field.

Ticket #133: Correction to vertical coordinate definition for 50-level 'UM6' global data.

Minor tweak to the 'interface height' in met definition files relevant to the "UM6G/R"
global met data sets. The interface height should be set at rho-level 30 (17410.000 m)
and not, as previously defined, at theta-level 30 (18000.00 m). This minor bug fix
affects the following primary met definition files:

 MetDefnUM6G.txt
 MetDefnUM6Gpp.txt
 MetDefnUM6R.txt
 MetDefnUM6Rpp.txt

and one supplementary chemistry grid definition based on the "UM6R" met definition:

 NAMEChemistryGridDefn_Eta.txt

The correction is unlikely to have a significant impact in terms of NAME results
when using these historic met data sets.
