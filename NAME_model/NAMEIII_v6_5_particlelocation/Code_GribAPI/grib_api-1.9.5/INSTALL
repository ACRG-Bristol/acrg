The grib_api installation is based on the standard configure utility. 
It is tested on several platforms and with several compilers. However for some platforms 
modifications to the installation engine may be required. If you encounter any problem 
during the installation procedure please send an e-mail with your problem to 
Software.Services@ecmwf.int.

The only required package for a standard installation is jasper which enables the jpeg2000 
packing/unpacking algorithm. 
It is possible to build grib_api without jasper, by using the --disable-jpeg configure option, 
but to install a fully functional library, its download is recommended.
