<h1><a class="anchor" name="grib_compare">grib_compare</a></h1><h2><a class="anchor" name="DESCRIPTION">
DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
Compare grib messages contained in two files. If some differences are found it fails returning an error code. Floating point values are compared exactly by default, different tolerance can be defined see -P -A -R. Default behaviour: absolute error=0, bit-by-bit compare, same order in files.<h2><a class="anchor" name="USAGE">
USAGE</a></h2>
grib_compare [options] grib_file grib_file<h2><a class="anchor" name="OPTIONS">
OPTIONS</a></h2>
-r <br>
 Compare files in which the messages are not in the same order. This option is time expensive. <br>
 <br>
 -b key,key,... <br>
 All the keys in this list are skipped in the comparison. Bit-by-bit compare on. <br>
 <br>
 -e <br>
 edition independent compare. It is used to compare grib edition 1 and 2. <br>
 <br>
 -c key[:l/d/s/n],key[:l/d/s/n],... <br>
 Only the listed keys or namespaces (:n) are compared. The optional letter after the colon is used to force the type in the comparison: l-&gt;integer, d-&gt;float, s-&gt;string, n-&gt;namespace. See -a option. Incompatible with -H option. <br>
 <br>
 -a <br>
 -c option modifier. The keys listed with the option -c will be added to the list of keys compared without -c. <br>
 <br>
 -H <br>
 Compare only message headers. Bit-by-bit compare on. Incompatible with -c option. <br>
 <br>
 -R key1=relative_error1,key2=relative_error2,... <br>
 Compare floating point values using the relative error as tolerance. key1=relative_error will compare key1 using relative_error1. all=relative_error will compare all the floating point keys using relative_error. Default all=0. <br>
 <br>
 -A absolute error <br>
 Compare floating point values using the absolute error as tolerance. Default is absolute error=0 <br>
 <br>
 -P <br>
 Compare data values using the packing error as tolerance. <br>
 <br>
 -T factor <br>
 Compare data values using factor multipied by the tolerance specified in options -P -R -A. <br>
 <br>
 -w key[:{s/d/l}]{=/!=}value,key[:{s/d/l}]{=/!=}value,... <br>
 Where clause. Grib messages are processed only if they match all the key/value constraints. A valid constraint is of type key=value or key!=value. For each key a string (key:s) or a double (key:d) or a long (key:l) type can be specified. Default type is string. <br>
 <br>
 -f <br>
 Force. Force the execution not to fail on error. <br>
 <br>
 -V <br>
 Version. <br>
 <br>
 -7 <br>
 Does not fail when the message has wrong length <br>
 <br>
 -v <br>
 Verbose. <br>
 <br>
 <h2><a class="anchor" name="grib_compare_examples">

<ol type=1>
<li>The default behaviour for grib_compare without any option is to perform a bit by bit comparison of the two messages. If the messages are found to be bitwise different then grib_compare switches to a "key based" mode to find out which coded keys are different. To see how grib_compare works we first set the shortName=2d (2 metre dew point temperature) in the file regular_latlon_surface.grib1<br>
 <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
&gt;grib_set -s shortName=2d regular_latlon_surface.grib1 2d.grib1
</pre></div> Then we can compare the two fields with grib_compare.<br>
 <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
&gt;grib_compare regular_latlon_surface.grib1 2d.grib1

-- GRIB #1 -- shortName=2t paramId=167 stepRange=0 levelType=sfc level=0 packingType=grid_simple gridType=regular_ll --
long [indicatorOfParameter]: [167] != [168]
</pre></div> In the output we see that the only "coded" key with different values in the two messages is indicatorOfParameter which is the relevant key for the parameter information. The comparison can be forced to be successful listing the keys with different values in the -b option. <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
&gt;grib_compare -b indicatorOfParameter regular_latlon_surface.grib1 2d.grib1
</pre></div> <br>
<br>
</li><li>Two grib messages can be very different because they have different edition, but they can contain the same identical information in the header and the same data. To see how grib_compare can help in comparing messages with different edition we do <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
&gt;grib_set edition=2 reduced_gaussian_model_level.grib1 reduced_gaussian_model_level.grib2
</pre></div> Then we compare the two fields with grib_compare.<br>

</pre></div> It is clear that the two messages are coded in a very different way. If we now add the -e option, the tool will compare only the higher level information common between the two messages. <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">

1 of 1 grib messages in reduced_gaussian_model_level.grib2

1 of 1 total grib messages in 1 files
</pre></div> For each key the type used in the comparison is reported and for the floating point keys also the tolerance used is printed. <br>
<br>
</li><li>Some options are provided to compare only a set of keys in the messages. The option -H is used to compare only the headers coded in the message, it doesn't compare the data values. The option "-c key1:[l/d/s/n],key2:[l/d/s/n],... " can be used to compare a set of keys or namespaces. The letter after the colon is optional and it is used to force the type used in the comparison which is otherwise assumed to be the native type of the key. The possible types are:<ul>
<li>:l -&gt; integer (C type long)</li><li>:d -&gt; floating point (C type double)</li><li>:s -&gt; string</li><li>:n -&gt; namespace.</li></ul>
When the type "n" is used all the set of keys belonging to the specified namespace are compared assuming their own native type. To illustrate how these options work we change the values coded in a message using grib_filter with the following rules file (see <a class="el" href="grib_filter.html">grib_filter</a>). <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
set bitsPerValue=10;
set values={1,2.5,3,4,5,6,70};
write "first.grib1";
set values={1,2.5,5,4,5,6,70};
write "second.grib1";
</pre></div> We first compare the two files using the -H option (only headers are compared). <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
&gt;grib_compare -H first.grib1 second.grib1
</pre></div> The comparison is successful because the data are not compared. To compare only the data we have to compare the "data namespace". <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
&gt;grib_compare -c data:n first.grib1 second.grib1

-- GRIB #1 -- shortName=t paramId=130 stepRange=0 levelType=ml level=1 packingType=grid_simple gridType=reduced_gg --
double [packedValues]: 1 out of 7 different,  max absolute diff. = 2, relative diff. = 0.4
	max diff. element 2: 3.00000000000000000000e+00 5.00000000000000000000e+00
	tolerance=0 packingError: [0.04] [0.04]
	values max= [70.04]  [70.04]         min= [1] [1]
</pre></div> The comparison is showing that one of seven values is different in a comparison with the (default) absolute tolerance=0. We can change the tolerance with the -A option: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
&gt;grib_compare -A 2 -c data:n first.grib1 second.grib1
</pre></div> and we see that the comparison is successful if the absolute tolerance is set to 2. We can also set the relative tolerance for each key with the option -R: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
&gt;grib_compare -R packedValues=0.4 -c data:n first.grib1 second.grib1
</pre></div> and we get again a successful comparison because the relative tolerance is bigger than the relative absolute difference of two corresponding values. Another possible choice for the tolerance is to be equal to the packingError, which is the error due to the packing algorithm. If we change the decimalPrecision of a packed field we introduce a packing error sometimes bigger than the original packing error. <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
&gt;grib_set -s changeDecimalPrecision=0 first.grib1 third.grib1
</pre></div> and we compare the two fields using the -P option (tolerance=packingError). <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
&gt;grib_compare -P -c data:n first.grib1 third.grib1
</pre></div> the comparison is successful because their difference is within the biggest of the two packing error. With the option -P the comparison is failing only if the original data coded are different, not if the packing precision is changed. If we try again to compare the fields without the -P option: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
&gt;grib_compare -c data:n first.grib1 third.grib1

-- GRIB #1 -- shortName=t paramId=130 stepRange=0 levelType=ml level=1 packingType=grid_simple gridType=reduced_gg --

	tolerance=0 packingError: [0.04] [0.5]
	values max= [70.04]  [70]         min= [1] [1]
</pre></div> we see that some values are different and that the maximum absolute differenc is close to the biggest packing error (max diff=0.48 packingError=0.5). The packing error was chosen to be 0.5 by setting decimalPrecision to 0 which means that we don't need to preserve any decimal figure.<br>
<br>
</li><li>When we already know that the fields are not numerically identical, but have similar statistical characteristics we can compare their statistics namespaces: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
&gt;grib_compare -c statistics:n first.grib1 third.grib1

-- GRIB #1 -- shortName=t paramId=130 stepRange=0 levelType=ml level=1 packingType=grid_simple gridType=reduced_gg --

	absolute diff. = 0.000359087, relative diff. = 0.000490071
	tolerance=0
</pre></div> and we see that maximum, minimum, average, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis are compared. While the values are different by 0.48 the statistics comparison shows that the difference in the statistical values is never bigger than 0.052 <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
&gt;grib_compare -A 0.052 -c statistics:n first.grib1 third.grib1
</pre></div> The statistics namespace is available also for spherical harmonics data and provides information about the field in the geographic space computing them in the spectral space for performance reasons. <br>
<br>
</li><li>When a file contains several fields and some keys are different, it is useful to have a summary report of the keys found different in the messages. This can be obtained with the option -f. We change few keys in a file: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
&gt;grib_set -w typeOfLevel=surface -s step=48 tigge_pf_ecmwf.grib2 out.grib2
