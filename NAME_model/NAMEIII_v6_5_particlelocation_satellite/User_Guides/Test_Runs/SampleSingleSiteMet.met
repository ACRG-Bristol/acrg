************************************************************************

This is a demonstration met file designed to illustrate the format required 
for such files. 

Only the information following the keywords 'VARIABLES:' and 'DATA:' is
read by the model. This enables extra information which is not read by
the model to be included in the met file - for example information on
the measurement site or comments such as these describing the format of
the file.

The met data are presented as a sequence of records, each record giving
the data for a particular hour. In each record, a number of met
variables (e.g. wind speed, surface sensible heat flux etc.) are given.
The same variables must be given for each hour, although if some values
are unknown this can be indicated by -999.0 as described below. The
information following the keyword 'VARIABLES:' tells the model how many
variables are given for each hour and what the variables are, while the
met data itself follows the keyword 'DATA:'. 
 
In the information after the keyword 'VARIABLES:', various keywords are 
used to indicate which met variables are given for each hour's data and
the order in which they are given. The number of possible input
variables is quite large in order to support a range of applications and
to allow for a variety of data sources - however the number of variables
used in any one application is likely to be a small fraction of those
possible. The variables fall into 4 categories, true met variables, site
characteristics, time variables and frequency information. Several of
the variables have aliases, i.e. alternative keywords. These are either
expanded definitions which are more self-explanatory or are present for
compatibility with past versions. The keywords are not case sensitive.
The meaning of the keywords is as follows:

1) Met variables:

ALPHA (M)

            in Holtslag and van Ulden, 1983, J. Clim. Appl. Met., vol 22, 
            517-529).
                                                                    
ALPHA (D)                                                 
Alias: MODIFIED PRIESTLEY-TAYLOR PARAMETER (DISPERSION AREA)     
Definition: Modified Priestley-Taylor parameter in dispersion area (as 
            defined in Holtslag and van Ulden, 1983, J. Clim. Appl. Met., 
            vol 22, 517-529).
                                                                    
1/LMO < (M)                                                
Alias: MAX 1/MONIN-OBUKHOV LENGTH (MET SITE)                     
Definition: Maximum value of 1/LMO at met site, with values > 1.0E6
            indicating no maximum.

Definition: Maximum value of 1/LMO in dispersion area, with values > 1.0E6
            indicating no maximum. 

These site variables will normally be input via the menu, but can be
input via the met file if not input through the menu (any values input
through the menu have precedence). Note that, for the variables which
limit the Monin-Obukhov length, missing data (-999.0) and values >
1.0E6 both imply no maximum.

3) Time variables:

HOUR    
Alias (supported for past compatibility only): THOUR   
Definition: Hour of day (e.g. 5.30am = 5.5). 
                                                          
DAY     
Alias (supported for past compatibility only): TDAY    
Definition: Day of year (e.g. 1st Jan = 1.0).
                                                          
YEAR    
Definition: Year (full 4 digit number, e.g. 1999.0).

TIME ZONE
Definition: The time zone in which the above time data are expressed, 
            specified as hours ahead of GMT (so that time zones to the 
            east of the Greenwich meridian will tend to have a positive 
            value and time zones to the west will tend to have a negative 
            value). If this variable is missing local mean time is 
            assumed, i.e. GMT + longitude in degrees (east positive)/15. 
            The value specified is the time zone applicable to all of the 
            variables HOUR, DAY and YEAR (to see how the time zone can be
            important for identifying the day and year note that, for 
            example, in one time zone the time may be 11.30pm on 31st 
            December 1999, while in another it may be 12.30am on 1st 
            January 2000). There are two subtleties concerning this 
            variable which users need to be aware of. (i) If the alias 
            THOUR is used for the hour of the day then the variable TIME 
            ZONE must not be included in the met file (including it will 
            result in an error message and termination of the model run) 
            and all times will be interpreted as local mean time. The 
            reason we have imposed this restriction is that any such file 
            would appear to work with ADMS 1 or 2 but would produce 
            erroneous results because these versions of ADMS do not 
            understand time zone information. (ii) Because different 
            values of TIME ZONE can be used for different hours of met 
            data, it is legitimate to use, for example, Greenwich Mean 
            Time in winter and British Summer Time in summer. 
                                                              
4) Frequency variables:
                                                              
FREQUENCY                                                     
Alias (supported for past compatibility only): FR 
Definition: Frequency with which a given set of met conditions occurs
            (arbitrary units, e.g. percentage of occasions or number of 
            hours per year).                                            

FREQUENCY FOR MONTHS ww TO xx, HOURS yyyyy TO zzzzz (GMT + hhhhh)          
Alias (supported for past compatibility only): MONTHS ww TO xx, HOURS yy TO zz
Definition: Detailed frequency information giving the frequency with which 
            a given set of met conditions occurs for certain months of the 
            year or times of day (same units as for the variable FREQUENCY). 
            'ww to xx' indicates the range of months covered, e.g. ' 1 to  3' 
            indicates January to March inclusive. 'yyyyy to zzzzz' indicates 
            the range of times covered, e.g. ' 1.50 to  4.50' indicates 
            1.30am to 4.30 am. '(GMT + hhhhh)' indicates the time zone used, 
            e.g. '(GMT +  1.00)' indicates a time zone one hour ahead of GMT. 
            If '(GMT + hhhhh)' is omitted local mean time is assumed, i.e. 
            GMT + longitude in degrees (east positive)/15. For the alias 
            name, 'yy to zz' also indicates the range of times but with a 
            different convention where, for example, ' 1 to 11' means the 
            first to the eleventh hour inclusive, i.e. 12 midnight to 11am 
            (AND NOT 1AM TO 11AM). For the alias name GMT is assumed (AND NOT 
            LOCAL MEAN TIME). The variables ww etc must have the same number 
            of characters (possibly including leading or trailing blanks) as 
            shown and must be reals or integers (i.e. must include or not 
            include a decimal point '.') in accordance with the examples 
            given. The time zone used must be the same for all 'detailed 
            frequency' variables.
Historical note: The alias name is not readable by ADMS 1 or 2, but was
                 introduced by the Met Office as a way of providing some 
                 extra information - to enable ADMS 1 or 2 to use this 
                 information the dataset had to be edited. Hence the alias 
                 name was not part of the previous ADMS standard for met 
                 files and is introduced here, not to provide compatibility 
                 with past versions of ADMS, but to enable previously 
                 supplied Met Office datasets to be used directly in ADMS 3.
                 This use was not envisioned when the data was originally 
                 supplied, which explains the differences in the 
                 interpretation of the range of times and the time zone 
                 between the name and its alias. 

The frequency variables must, if they are mentioned in the header,
be present for every set of met data (i.e. -999.0 will cause a fatal
error) and the basic frequency variable FREQUENCY must be included
whenever detailed frequency data are present. Also, although it is not
prohibited, we advise users against using time variables (HOUR, DAY, YEAR,
TIME ZONE, or their aliases) and detailed frequency data in the same file
unless they fully understand how ADMS would treat this.

The met data itself which follows the keyword 'DATA:' must be formatted
as a comma separated list. Each variable must be a real (as opposed to
an integer - i.e. it must contain a '.') and missing data can be
indicated by -999.0 or by omitting the variable (the comma must however
still be present). Missing data or invalid data (e.g. negative boundary
layer depth) may cause error messages to be generated.

Units are SI units except where stated in the variable definitions above. 

All keywords must start in the first column.

This example file includes some examples of missing and invalid data.
