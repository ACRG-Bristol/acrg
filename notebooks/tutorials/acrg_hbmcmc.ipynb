    "The set of modules in acrg_hbmcmc allow a convenient way to perform 'hierachical Bayesian MCMC'. \\\n",
    "That is, we want to infer emissions of a partiular species (and the influence from the domain boundary) using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The 'hierarchy' is that this depends on 'hyperparameters', which are generally the uncertainties in the non-latent parameters involved in the estimation (i.e. not those we are trying to derive – the emissions – but others that are necessary, e.g. the measurement error). \\\n",
