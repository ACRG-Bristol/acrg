[INPUT.MEASUREMENTS]
; Input values for extracting observations
; species - species name (see acrg_species_info.json for options) e.g. "ch4"
; sites - site codes as a list (see acrg_site_info.json for options) e.g. ["MHD"]
; meas_period - Time periods for measurements as a list (must match length of sites)
; start_date - Start of observations to extract (format YYYY-MM-DD)
; end_date - End of observations to extract (format YYYY-MM-DD) (non-inclusive)

[INPUT.PRIORS]
; Input values for extracting footprints, emissions and boundary conditions files (also uses values from INPUT.MEASUREMENTS)
; domain - Name of inversion spatial domain e.g. "EUROPE"
; fpheight - Release height for footprints. e.g. fpheight = {"TAC":"185m"} (must match number of sites).

[INPUT.BASIS_CASE]
; Input values to extract the basis cases to use within the inversion for boundary conditions and emissions
; bc_basis_case - boundary conditions basis, defaults to "NESW" (looks for file format {bc_basis_case}_{domain}_*.nc)
; fp_basis_case - emissions bases:
; - if specified, looks for file format {fp_basis_case}_{domain}_*.nc
; - if None, creates basis function using quadtree algorithm and associated parameters
